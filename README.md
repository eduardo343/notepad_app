📒 Ruby on Rails Notebook App
This is a "notepad"-style web application built with Ruby on Rails 8, allowing users to create Notebooks and add Pages inside them, each with a title, content, and a random emoji.

It's ideal for practicing modern Rails with Turbo, Tailwind CSS, and a PostgreSQL database.

✅ What can you do with this app?
Create, view, edit, and delete Notebooks.
Inside each notebook, you can create multiple Pages.
Each page includes:
A random emoji fetched from an external API.
A title and content (body).
Delete notebooks or pages with visual confirmation.
Use a modern interface with Bootstrap + TailwindCSS.
Enjoy fast navigation thanks to Hotwire/Turbo (no page reloads).
